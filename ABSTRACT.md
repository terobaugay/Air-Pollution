# Abstract for Project

## Project Idea
- Build a machine learning-powered web app
- Classify air pollution levels using clustering
- Categorize data based on patterns
- Make the tool accessible via a web interface

## Main Objectives
- Train and use clustering models to predict pollution levels
- Develop a Streamlit-based app to make predictions user-friendly
- Allow users to upload `.csv` files
- Provide fast and clear output
- Make pollution analysis accessible to non-technical users

## Methodology
- Use supervised and unsupervised learning
- Accepts `.csv` input files via Streamlit
- Loads a pre-trained model with `joblib`
- Predicts clusters from the uploaded dataset

### Libraries Used:
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib.pyplot  
- joblib  
- streamlit  

## Conclusion
- Fully functional web app for predicting air pollution levels
- No coding or ML knowledge needed for end users
- Useful for:
  - Analyzing air quality patterns
  - Evaluating pollution zones
  - Educational use by students and teachers
